# brain-networks
 Here, for learning purposes, we try to apply the techniques from the book "Fundamentals of Brain Network Analysis"



# Articles to consider in the future


## Motif analysis

## Topological dimension

see rentian scaling

"A recurrent theme throughout 
this book has been that wiring cost minimization is an important principle for 
brain network organization, but wiring cost minimization alone seems insufficient 
to account for all topological characteristics of nervous systems. Rather, nervous 
systems are subject to the competitive selection pressures of wiring cost mini- 
mization and topological complexity. In optimizing this trade-off, neural systems 
are highly economical, such that that their wiring cost is near minimal given their 
level of topological complexity"
