 Here, for learning purposes, we try to apply the techniques from the book "Fundamentals of Brain Network Analysis"



# Articles to consider in the future

## Basics


The Brain as a Complex System: Using Network Science as a Tool for Understanding the Brain
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3621511/


## Modularity


A hierarchical method for whole‐brain connectivity‐based parcellation
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6869099/ (with spatial constraints)

Maps of random walks on complex networks reveal community structure
https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0706851105
(idea:  The high interconnectivity of nodes within a module can ensnare a random walker, meaning that it spends more time visiting those nodes and less time transitioning between communities. )

## Topological dimension

see **rentian scaling**

*"A recurrent theme throughout this book has been that wiring cost minimization is an important principle for brain network organization, but wiring cost minimization alone seems insufficient to account for all topological characteristics of nervous systems. Rather, nervous systems are subject to the competitive selection pressures of wiring cost minimization and topological complexity. In optimizing this trade-off, neural systems are highly economical, such that that their wiring cost is near minimal given their level of topological complexity"*
